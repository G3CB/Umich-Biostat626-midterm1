# Here is the instruction my R code:
#1. Read the training and Testing data into R.
#2. Do the data processing for binary classification. Set dynamic activity to 0 and all other activity to 1.
#3. From here we train the model, what I used is GLM model with binomial distribution.
#4. Last step of the binary classification is to do he prediction with our model the and the testing data set. And generate the result into a text file.
#5. Do a different data processing for multi class classification	. Let postural transitions equal to 7, and let activity 1 to 6 stay the exactly the same.
#6. Now we train the model for multi class classification. I used a cross validation SVM model.
#7.Last step of the multi class classification is to do he prediction with our model the and the testing data set. And generate the result into a text file.
